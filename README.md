A comprehensive Go-based tool that combines Kubernetes health monitoring with cost optimization capabilities would provide significant value to the Kubernetes ecosystem. Here's how we could approach this:
Core Features to Consider

Health Monitoring

Pod/node health status tracking
Resource utilization metrics
API server response times
Control plane component health

Cost Management

Resource usage per namespace/pod/deployment
Idle resource identification
Right-sizing recommendations
Cloud provider cost integration

Optimization Actions

Automated scaling recommendations
Bin-packing optimizations
Spot instance recommendations
Namespace cost allocation

Dependencies & Technology Stack

Go: Primary language (v1.21+)
Kubernetes Libraries:

client-go: For interacting with Kubernetes API
controller-runtime: For implementing controllers
metrics-server API: For collecting resource metrics

Prometheus: For metrics collection and storage
Cloud Provider SDKs:

AWS SDK for Go
Google Cloud Go SDK
Azure SDK for Go

Web Framework: Gin or Echo for REST API
Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite for historical data
UI: React or Vue.js for web dashboard (optional)

Implementation Approach for Key Features
This project will combine real-time monitoring with historical analysis to provide both immediate health insights and long-term cost optimization recommendations.

Pod Collector Features:

Comprehensive Pod Metrics:

Pod status and phase
Container statuses with restart counts
Resource requests/limits and actual usage
Pod conditions and readiness
Owner references and QoS class

Advanced Analysis:

Namespace-based pod metrics
Resource utilization tracking
QoS class distribution
Problematic pod identification

Alert Detection:

Failed or pending pods
High restart counts
Resource overcommitment
Long-running pending pods

Control Plane Collector Features:

Component Health Monitoring:

API server health checks (livez/readyz endpoints)
Controller manager status
Scheduler status
etcd cluster health

Cluster Information:

Kubernetes version tracking
Leader election status
API error monitoring
Component response times

Advanced Features:

Component pod status tracking
Container status within control plane pods
Overall control plane health status
Alert generation for component failures

Both collectors follow the same interface pattern with Start(), Stop(), Collect(), and AlertableMetrics() methods, ensuring consistent integration with the health monitoring system.
The collectors provide rich data that can be used for:

Health monitoring dashboards
Alert generation
Cost optimization decisions
Capacity planning
Troubleshooting cluster issues

Alert Manager Features:

Alert Management:

Create, track, and resolve alerts
Alert history tracking
Silencing/muting capabilities
Severity levels (critical, warning, info)

Rule-Based Alerting:

Configurable alert rules with conditions
Threshold-based triggers
Duration requirements
Repeat intervals for notifications

Default Alert Rules:

High CPU/memory utilization
Pod restart thresholds
Node not ready conditions
Long-pending pods
Control plane health issues

Notification System:

Multi-channel alert notifications
Alert resolution notifications
Silencing support
Notification throttling

Alert Lifecycle:

Active/resolved/silenced states
Start time and duration tracking
Resolution notifications
Historical record keeping

The Alert Manager integrates with the collectors to evaluate metrics against rules and trigger appropriate notifications. It provides a robust foundation for monitoring cluster health and responding to issues proactively.

Cost Providers

AWS Cost Provider - Handles AWS-specific cost retrieval, pricing data, and optimization savings estimates
GCP Cost Provider - Manages Google Cloud pricing, machine type parsing, and cost calculations
Azure Cost Provider - Integrates with Azure APIs for VM pricing and cost management

Recommender Components

Rightsizing Recommender - Identifies overprovisioned resources and generates recommendations for optimal resource allocation
Idle Resources Recommender - Detects idle or underutilized resources across nodes, pods, deployments, and other components

These components provide:

Resource cost tracking across different cloud providers
Intelligent rightsizing recommendations based on actual utilization
Detection of idle resources to minimize waste
Prioritized recommendations with confidence scores
Estimated savings calculations
Comprehensive metrics analysis

The implementation follows best practices with proper error handling, caching mechanisms, configurable thresholds, and extensible architecture. Each component integrates seamlessly with the main KubeCostGuard system to provide comprehensive cost optimization functionality.
Would you like me to create any additional components or explain any specific implementation details?

calculateVariance - Calculates the statistical variance of metric values to assess how much they fluctuate over time
estimateCPUCost - Estimates the monthly cost for CPU resources based on milli-cores
estimateMemoryCost - Estimates the monthly cost for memory resources
calculateUtilizationStats - Calculates peak and average utilization from metric history
checkCustomResources - Discovers and checks custom resources that support scaling
analyzeStatefulSetScaling - Full implementation for StatefulSet scaling analysis
getStatefulSetMetrics - Gets metrics for StatefulSet
calculateStatefulSetCost - Calculates cost for StatefulSet resources
generateStatefulSetScalingActions - Generates specific scaling actions for StatefulSet
scaleStatefulSet - Applies scaling recommendations to StatefulSet

The calculateVariance function specifically:

Takes a slice of MetricPoint values
Calculates the mean of the values
Computes the variance by finding the average of squared differences from the mean
Returns 0 for datasets with less than 2 points (no variance possible)

This helps the scaler determine if metrics are stable enough to make confident scaling recommendations - high variance might indicate unpredictable workloads that shouldn't be scaled automatically.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. 3.7 Sonnet

JWT and Basic auth implementation placeholders

The API now provides comprehensive endpoints for monitoring costs, health, and optimizations while maintaining clean interfaces that can be easily implemented by the actual backend services.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. 3.7 Sonnet

Thread-safe cache updates

Caching:

In-memory caches for all resources
Thread-safe cache access with read/write locks
Fast lookups by name/namespace

Watch specific resources

Usage Example:
go// Create informer manager

log.Fatal(err)
}

// Start informers
if err := im.Start(); err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}

// Add custom event handlers
im.AddPodEventHandler(cache.ResourceEventHandlerFuncs{
UpdateFunc: func(old, new interface{}) {
// Handle pod updates
},
})

// Access cached resources
if node, ok := im.GetNode("node-1"); ok {
// Use node
}

// List resources
pods := im.ListPodsByNamespace("default")
for \_, pod := range pods {
// Process pods
}

// Cleanup
defer im.Stop()
The implementation ensures efficient resource monitoring with minimal API calls by using informers and caching mechanisms.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
